"""The `reporting` suite: the role's requirement, which this plugin holds
itself to.

Each case says, in the contract's words, what the deployment presents and
what the plugin reads or hears. Here each is run through the plugin's own
reads (report.py), against a `Recorder`: the plugin's typed operations,
recorded rather than sent, answered as `answer` says for the case. A row the
plugin hears is handed to its own `on_<row>` method, bound to the recorder.

As you change what the plugin reports, keep every case passing.
