"""A Meridian plugin, as `meridian plugin new` writes one.

It runs on the sidecar it is launched beside, declaring its pages, says who
it was launched as and what the deployment lets it do, serves the pages
people reach through the dashboard (page.py), reports itself healthy, and
runs until it is stopped. Heartbeats are sent for it.

Everything a plugin does goes through that sidecar. It holds no credential,
knows no other address, and cannot choose its own identity or grants: those
come from how the deployment launched it. Start from here -- each role the
plugin holds is one class, `meridian.roles.<role>.Role`, whose acts are the
steps that role may take, and nothing else reaches the bus -- and keep it
that way. This one registers a custody class (page.py), started only where
the deployment launched it with `custody`.
